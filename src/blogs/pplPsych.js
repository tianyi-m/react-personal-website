      <p class="blog-title">People I Met in the Psych Ward</p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        I’ve met various people in different psych wards. Some of them are really interesting, so I decided to write about them in this series. It also helps to demystify the psych ward.

        1. “Can I get a cup of coffee?”
        </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Because some people are aggressive and others are bored, there is always chaos and sometimes minor conflicts in one of the psych wards I stayed at. In short, sometimes situations are scary in this particular psych ward I stayed at. People are not nice to each other, and sometimes they yell. But there is always this one tall back guy, who always asks for a cup of coffee. So when everyone is kind of nervous in a situation and the nurses are busy settling things, only him will just go up straight to the nurse and ask: “Can I get a cup of coffee? ” He is always in his own head, walking back and forth, and occasionally goes up to the nurses (in his own time) and asks: “Can I get a cup of coffee? ” It was so funny.

        2. “I have two children! ”
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        It is also in this psych ward that I encountered a true narcissist. I have my own ego so sometimes I thought I might be a narcissist, but she made me realize what a true narcissist are like. She always dresses really flashily, with sparkles and vibrant colors. It’s not to say that everyone who dresses like that is a narcissist, but it just happened to be the case that her dresses are particularly loud And she is a narcissist. She lies a lot. She said she has two children and she needs to take care of them, but the truth is that she never had two children. She also makes various demands repeatedly like she is in pain and needs medicine when she already got the medicine and won’t stop until someone attends to her. Regardless of what other people want to do, Her needs have to be attended to First. I guess that’s the sign of a narcissist. Now I know.

        3. The Performer
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        There is a guy who always dresses nicely. He wants my clothes, which is kind of creepy, and later he admitted that he had a crush on me. He is generally a good person. He likes to dance and make jokes, even sometimes he can be a bit aggressive and it scares me. We have music sessions on the floor, and he would dance and invite me to dance with him. He also has complained to me that he likes Asian girls but they never liked him back. He would share food with other people, and make jokes to alleviate nervous situations, like when there is tension between patients. He can be quite moody though. When he is happy, he would dance and make jokes, but for example, say, when I didn’t like him back, he would say things like “everything about you (me) is wrong”, which I probably shouldn’t take so seriously. He is generally a good kid.
