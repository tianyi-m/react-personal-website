        “I’m Tianyi, and I struggle with motivation.”
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Starting from mid September, I’ve been living the idlest time of my life -- I’m in my last semester of college and only have one class. For the first time in my life, large chunks of my time are free, and I don’t know what to do. I spent a lot of my time hanging out with friends and family. I also did a little bit of extracurriculars, attended the film club every Friday, cooked sometimes, was doing a part-time full-stack engineering gig, and started doing computational philosophy (will write more about this later) with a professor from last year’s philosophy class. But when I was alone, I didn’t do anything productive, stimulating or meaningful -- I simply watched YouTube. When I got up every morning, the first thought was not: “What an empty, beautiful day to experience life!”. Instead, it was either: “Oh gosh, I have so much work to do today”, or “I don’t know what to do with my life and don’t want to deal with it at all”. I always imagine that I will be so free and happy having extra free time, but I am not used to not having any responsibilities, having more time in my hand than I can handle, and living alone.

        The problem is not that I don’t have any ideas. The problem is that I have so many ideas that I don’t know how to choose from. I’m always not a fan of the “just pick something fun and get your hands dirty quick” mindset, and was working way too hard to find the perfect reason to make day-to-day decisions. What’s my long-term goal? What am I most interested in? What will make me look interesting to other people? Do I develop a new hobby, or do I revisit some of my lost, old hobbies? As a perfectionist, I spent way too much time ruminating and weighthing all the factors trying to make the best decision ever. One point, I might think: “Oh, it’s such a good idea to read and draw! ”, and at another point, I might be like: “Actually let’s start a podcast!”

      <p class="blog-content">
        Eventually, my solution is to just give up. For about two to three weeks, I simply watched YouTube videos when I was alone and didn't have any responsibilities. It felt okay. At first, I still felt bad when watching videos. I would talk to my mom about it every night, complaining that I didn’t do anything, and swear that I’m going to do something interesting in the future. Gradually, I accepted my “fate”, and felt okay -- I’m doing my school work on time, and sometimes ahead of time; I’m hanging out with friends and family a lot; I’m even working on research and a part-time internship. Honestly, I’m doing fine.

        Last week, I did a little bit more when I was by myself. I recorded a podcast episode with my co-host; I read for a couple of hours; and I drew. It felt good. I was still spending most of my alone time watching YouTube videos or napping, but I did something fun.

        One night, I coincidentally stumbled upon my friend’s blog. One of her blogs was “Living horizontally or vertically?”. Essentially, what it’s discussing is whether we should live a goal-oriented or experience-oriented lifestyle. I.e., whether we should explore as much as possible, trying out many different interests, or we should set a long-term goal, and spend most of our time working towards it. It expressed the concern that it’s impossible for one to live both “directions”, and her own struggle to balance both. Her final conclusion is that she is going to try to live both lifestyles as much as possible, and to prioritize exploring “horizontally” until decide not to. I felt it deeply. For me, picking one area to work on is just impossible. I realized I spent so much time trying to choose one, that I wasted the time and resources to actually explore one or two of those areas. The point is not to choose one and work on it forever, but to spend a significant amount of time working on multiple areas. I was treating developing a hobby and spending free time as a goal to achieve, while in reality it should be something fun and free-formed. 
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Then of course, I was again treating it like a goal to achieve -- I made a time schedule in my mind to follow the next day. Get up, learn an online course until 5, and read and draw. The next day, I was so stressed to reach my time schedule that I didn’t end up doing anything at all. I felt terrible. I couldn’t sleep at night, thinking about what’s wrong and how I can do better tomorrow. Suddenly, a sense of familiarity hit me -- I felt exactly the same as in middle school, when I was planning in advance to review for my exams and didn’t end up following any of my good plans! Why? Because I don’t care! “Getting good grades” was something my environment put in my mind, and I don’t desire it at all! Why was I pushing myself to “achieve” a good time, when there is no exterior pressure at all? I should, simply, enjoy myself.

      <p class="blog-content">
        At the end of the day, all I have to do is get moving and occupy myself. Do what’s interesting to you, and let your passion and interests lead you, instead of letting external standards guide your interests. Do as much as possible, and spend your time to the fullest. That’s the best life I could ever ask for.
