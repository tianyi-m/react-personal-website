        When I said “quiet”, what came to your mind? Probably dead silence. In fact, that’s not what “quiet” means to me. Quietness is a powerful tool to communicate, surprisingly. Wanna find out why? Continue reading!

        When you talk a lot, you are not listening. My mom talks to me all the time. That means our time together is filled with her spilling out sentences to my face. But I don’t feel energized after I talk to her at all. I always feel tired. And yet I enjoy the company of other people. When I’m with those people, I’m not completely silent at all. We do talk, but there is a balance, or consensus, or “threshold” that can be achieved. We don’t have to not talk, but we just have to kind of “tune in” to each other’s channel to reach a point where we are each comfortable with. That makes both of us comfortable. For me as an introvert, if the threshold is relatively high, which means that there are constantly loud conversations going on, usually I need to put more energy into this conversation. Thus, quietness gives me comfort. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t talk at all. This is the distinction here. What “quiet” means to me is a much more relaxed and chill atmosphere. Nothing much is going on, but Something is going on. It’s subtle, and it’s fun. Maybe you are playing a game, and I’m reading a book. But I’ll look up occasionally and comment on what you did. Freeing up energy used on listening, processing, and speaking also gives space for random thoughts. Maybe I got an idea, and I can just tell you that idea, and we can bounce ideas off each other. When I’m not relaxed, it’s harder to get random ideas, because all of my mental energy is used on socializing. It’s easier to have more in-depth conversations this way too, because random ideas sometimes lead to deep intellectual discussions, which is even more fun!

        On the other hand, it is important to listen to each other. A lot of the times when we are talking we are just talking At another person, instead of talking With the other person. When my mom and I are talking, she simply expresses her opinions all the time, instead of listening to what I have to say and being more responsive. Nobody is going to derive any satisfaction from this kind of conversation. It just leads to more frustration. In this aspect, talking less actually helps, because although you are not listening to each other, you are also not talking that much. Not listening to each other is a necessary part of socializing, but reducing the amount of talking helps with the frustration of not being able to listen to each other.
